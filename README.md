Recent Tab List for Safari
=====================

A Safari extension that keeps track of recently closed tabs and allows you to reopen them quickly. Will also (optionally) display currently open tabs. With a live text filter for easy searching.

Right now it has 4 settings:
- Number of recent tabs in the list
- Open tabs in foreground or background
- Show/hide currently open tabs
- Show website icon (uses a web service from http://g.etfv.co)

Limitations
-----------

- It only opens the most recent URL from any closed tab. The Safari extension API doesn’t allow any access to a tab’s history. It may be possible to recreate a rough tab history by injecting JavaScript into each page to track URL changes, but I chose not to go that far.
